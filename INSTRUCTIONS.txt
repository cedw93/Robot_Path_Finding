occupancy.grid contains an occupancy grid (map) of the environment.
You may read in this file, or just hard code the values (eg as a 2d array)
in your program. 

`0` Represents an empty tile - ie your robot can move there.
`1` Represents an obstacle in the tile - ie your robot cannot move there.
`2` Is the starting point of the robot.
`3` Is the desired finish.

You should be able to see a blue grid in the stage window with some cells
coloured grey, other white. This is a visual representation of the occupancy
grid.

occupancy_with_error.grid contains an innacurate map for those wishing to deal
with such problems.

If you want to change the start position of the robot you must change it in
the occupancy grid AND in simple.world. To change the simple.world file, look
for the `pose' line in the pioneer2dx_base class. The first two values are
the x/y starting coordinates. The default is 9.5/9.5 which should start the
robot in the upper right corner.
